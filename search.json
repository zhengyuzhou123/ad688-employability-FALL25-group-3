Job postings by industry\n2. Salary distributions\n3. Remote vs. on-site job proportions\n\n\n2.1 Job Postings by Industry\nUnderstanding industry demand helps reveal which sectors are most active in hiring.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport os\n\n# Load dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"data/cleaned_lightcast.csv\", low_memory=False)\n\n# Ensure /figures directory exists\nos.makedirs(\"figures\", exist_ok=True)\n\n# col\nindustry_col = \"NAICS_2022_6_NAME\"\n\n# Clean up column names\ndf.columns = df.columns.str.strip()\n\n#drop unclassified\ndf = df[~df[\"NAICS_2022_6_NAME\"].str.lower().str.contains(\"unclassified\", na=False)]\n\n# Count top 10 industries\ntop_industries = df[industry_col].value_counts().head(10)\n\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.barplot(x=top_industries.values, y=top_industries.index, orient=\"h\")\nplt.title(\"Top 10 Industries by Job Postings\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Number of Job Postings\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Industry\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.savefig(\"figures/industry_postings.png\", dpi=300)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA bar chart was chosen to visualize the number of job postings across different industries. This format makes it easy to compare industry demand and helps job seekers understand which sectors have the highest hiring activity.\nJob demand is concentrated in tech and professional services: Custom Computer Programming Services leads, followed closely by Management Consulting, Employment Placement Agencies, and Computer Systems Design—each with ~4–5k postings. After these, volumes drop sharply to a second tier (Commercial Banking, CPA offices, Temporary Help, Health/Medical Insurance, Other Computer Services, Colleges/Universities) at ~1.3–2.0k. The prominence of staffing/placement agencies signals broad, economy-wide hiring, while the tech-heavy top ranks highlight sustained demand for digital and knowledge-worker skills.\n\n\n2.2 Salary Distribution by Industry\n\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nos.makedirs(\"figures\", exist_ok=True)\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"data/cleaned_lightcast.csv\", low_memory=False)\n\n# Define column names\nindustry_col = \"NAICS_2022_6_NAME\"\nsalary_col = \"SALARY\"\n\n# Filter and clean salary\ndf = df[df[salary_col] &gt; 0]\n#df = df[~df[industry_col].str.lower().str.contains(\"unclassified\")]\n\n# Compute average salary by industry\navg_salary = (\n    df.groupby(industry_col)[salary_col]\n    .mean()\n    .sort_values(ascending=False)\n    .head(10)\n)\n\n# Visual\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.barplot(\n    x=avg_salary.values,\n    y=avg_salary.index,\n    orient=\"h\"\n)\nplt.title(\"Average Salary by Industry (Excluding Unclassified)\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Average Salary ($)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Industry\")\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n# save\nplt.savefig(\"figures/average_salary_by_industry.png\", dpi=300, bbox_inches=\"tight\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother bar chart was used to present the average salary across industries. Bar charts are effective for showing ranked values, making it easy to identify the highest-paying sectors and support data-driven career decisions.\nAverage pay skews toward specialized, capital-intensive niches. Polish & Other Sanitation Good Manufacturing tops the list (~$215k), followed by Rubber & Plastics Hoses/Belting and Agents for Wireless Telecommunications Services (~$185–$200k). A middle tier includes Irradiation Apparatus and Misc. Waste Management (~$175–$185k), while Web Search Portals, Plastics Bag/Pouch, and transport/retail (Rail Support, Electronics & Appliance Retailers, Wineries) cluster near the lower bound (~$150–$165k). Overall, excluding unclassified roles, high salaries concentrate in specialized manufacturing and regulated services.\n\n\n2.3 Remote vs. On-Site Jobs\n\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nos.makedirs(\"figures\", exist_ok=True)\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"data/cleaned_lightcast.csv\", low_memory=False)\n\n# Clean the REMOTE_TYPE_NAME column\ndf[\"REMOTE_TYPE_NAME\"] = (\n    df[\"REMOTE_TYPE_NAME\"]\n    .astype(str).str.strip().str.lower()\n    .replace({\"[none]\": None, \"none\": None, \"unknown\": None, \"nan\": None, \"na\": None, \"null\": None, \"\": None})\n)\n\n# Count each type\nremote_counts = df[\"REMOTE_TYPE_NAME\"].value_counts()\n\n# Visual\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))\nplt.pie(\n    remote_counts.values,\n    labels=remote_counts.index,\n    autopct=\"%1.1f%%\",\n    startangle=90,\n    wedgeprops={\"edgecolor\": \"white\"}\n)\nplt.title(\"Remote vs. On-Site Job Distribution\", fontsize=13)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.savefig(\"figures/remote_vs_onsite.png\", dpi=300, bbox_inches=\"tight\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pie chart was selected to display the proportions of job types (remote, hybrid, and on-site). This format offers an intuitive visual summary, helping job seekers understand the flexibility of job opportunities in 2024.\nThe job market here is overwhelmingly remote: nearly four out of five postings (78.4%) are fully remote, while another 14.4% offer hybrid options. Only 7.3% require full on-site work. This mix signals strong employer flexibility and broad access to roles regardless of location, with hybrid emerging as a meaningful—but secondary—model. For candidates, remote-first skills (self-management, async collaboration) are likely at a premium, while fully on-site opportunities are comparatively scarce."

    "section": "Trend Analysis",
    "text": "Trend Analysis\nThis section examines geographic and remote work dynamics in the 2024–2025 U.S. labor market.\nAI-related jobs are highly concentrated in tech and policy hubs. Washington, D.C. leads with 4.4% of postings requiring AI skills, followed by Washington State and Delaware. At the city level, New York, Seattle, and San Jose dominate in absolute AI job postings, while D.C. has the highest proportion. Nationally, postings mentioning AI skills rose 20% year-over-year in 2024, with generative AI skills nearly quadrupling (Lightcast and Stanford HAI (2025), 1–17). In contrast, non-AI job growth is broad-based: 33 states reported employment gains in 2024, led by Rochester, MN (+6.5%) and Stockton–Lodi, CA (+5.3%), driven by healthcare and logistics (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2023), 1–2).\nRemote work has stabilized at a “new normal.” Although job postings labeled remote declined from &gt;10% in 2022 to ~7.5% in May 2025 (Indeed Hiring Lab (2024)), telework rates remain far above pre-pandemic levels, with ~20% of workers telecommuting in 2024 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2024), 12). By industry, remote adoption is highest in IT, finance, and management (Makridis (2024), 16; Bick, Blandin, and Mertens (2024), 7)), while healthcare, retail, and manufacturing remain predominantly on-site. Employers are shifting toward hybrid models, often requiring more in-office presence, though remote-capable roles continue to play a significant role (Barrero, Bloom, and Davis (2023), 20–21).\nTraditional tech hubs like Silicon Valley and New York City remain dominant in high-skill hiring, with over 65% of AI engineers located in these regions as of 2024. Despite rising costs and the expansion of remote work, their strong innovation ecosystems and dense talent networks preserve their competitive edge. At the same time, geographic diversification is accelerating: Miami and San Diego are emerging as fast-growing hubs, driven by lifestyle appeal, lower living costs, and, in Miami’s case, favorable tax policies. Miami saw a 12% increase in AI roles, while San Diego experienced a 7% rise in Big Tech hiring and raised $5.7 billion in venture capital. Conversely, former growth leaders like Austin and Houston are losing momentum, with startup employment declining by 6% and 10.9%, respectively, due to infrastructure gaps, cultural mismatch, and a shift back toward hybrid work models (SignalFire (2025)).\nGenerative AI introduces a reversal in the geography of job market exposure compared to earlier automation technologies. Whereas prior waves of automation—such as robotics and enterprise software—primarily disrupted rural and small-town economies by replacing routine manual or physical labor, generative AI disproportionately affects urban, high-skill, white-collar labor markets. These urban centers, including San Jose, San Francisco, New York, and Washington D.C., are home to occupations rich in cognitive, nonroutine tasks such as coding, writing, and data analysis—tasks highly susceptible to AI augmentation or displacement(Muro, Methkupally, and Kinder (2025)).\nAs a result, AI exposure rates in urban counties often exceed 40%, while rural counties average closer to 30%, reflecting both differing occupational structures and varying access to information-oriented industries. While rural areas may be more insulated from AI disruption, they are also less likely to benefit from AI-driven productivity gains. This spatial shift in exposure demands new policy attention focused on urban workforce reskilling, while also ensuring rural communities are not left behind in the emerging AI economy(Muro, Methkupally, and Kinder (2025))."

Remote vs. on-site job proportions\n\n\n2.1 Job Postings by Industry\nUnderstanding industry demand helps reveal which sectors are most active in hiring.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport os\n\n# Load dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"data/cleaned_lightcast.csv\", low_memory=False)\n\n# Ensure /figures directory exists\nos.makedirs(\"figures\", exist_ok=True)\n\n# col\nindustry_col = \"NAICS_2022_6_NAME\"\n\n# Clean up column names\ndf.columns = df.columns.str.strip()\n\n#drop unclassified\ndf = df[~df[\"NAICS_2022_6_NAME\"].str.lower().str.contains(\"unclassified\", na=False)]\n\n# Count top 10 industries\ntop_industries = df[industry_col].value_counts().head(10)\n\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.barplot(x=top_industries.values, y=top_industries.index, orient=\"h\")\nplt.title(\"Top 10 Industries by Job Postings\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Number of Job Postings\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Industry\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.savefig(\"figures/industry_postings.png\", dpi=300)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA bar chart was chosen to visualize the number of job postings across different industries. This format makes it easy to compare industry demand and helps job seekers understand which sectors have the highest hiring activity.\nJob demand is concentrated in tech and professional services: Custom Computer Programming Services leads, followed closely by Management Consulting, Employment Placement Agencies, and Computer Systems Design—each with ~4–5k postings. After these, volumes drop sharply to a second tier (Commercial Banking, CPA offices, Temporary Help, Health/Medical Insurance, Other Computer Services, Colleges/Universities) at ~1.3–2.0k. The prominence of staffing/placement agencies signals broad, economy-wide hiring, while the tech-heavy top ranks highlight sustained demand for digital and knowledge-worker skills.\n\n\n2.2 Salary Distribution by Industry\n\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nos.makedirs(\"figures\", exist_ok=True)\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"data/cleaned_lightcast.csv\", low_memory=False)\n\n# Define column names\nindustry_col = \"NAICS_2022_6_NAME\"\nsalary_col = \"SALARY\"\n\n# Filter and clean salary\ndf = df[df[salary_col] &gt; 0]\n#df = df[~df[industry_col].str.lower().str.contains(\"unclassified\")]\n\n# Compute average salary by industry\navg_salary = (\n    df.groupby(industry_col)[salary_col]\n    .mean()\n    .sort_values(ascending=False)\n    .head(10)\n)\n\n# Visual\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.barplot(\n    x=avg_salary.values,\n    y=avg_salary.index,\n    orient=\"h\"\n)\nplt.title(\"Average Salary by Industry (Excluding Unclassified)\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Average Salary ($)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Industry\")\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n# save\nplt.savefig(\"figures/average_salary_by_industry.png\", dpi=300, bbox_inches=\"tight\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother bar chart was used to present the average salary across industries. Bar charts are effective for showing ranked values, making it easy to identify the highest-paying sectors and support data-driven career decisions.\nAverage pay skews toward specialized, capital-intensive niches. Polish & Other Sanitation Good Manufacturing tops the list (~$215k), followed by Rubber & Plastics Hoses/Belting and Agents for Wireless Telecommunications Services (~$185–$200k). A middle tier includes Irradiation Apparatus and Misc. Waste Management (~$175–$185k), while Web Search Portals, Plastics Bag/Pouch, and transport/retail (Rail Support, Electronics & Appliance Retailers, Wineries) cluster near the lower bound (~$150–$165k). Overall, excluding unclassified roles, high salaries concentrate in specialized manufacturing and regulated services.\n\n\n2.3 Remote vs. On-Site Jobs\n\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nos.makedirs(\"figures\", exist_ok=True)\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"data/cleaned_lightcast.csv\", low_memory=False)\n\n# Clean the REMOTE_TYPE_NAME column\ndf[\"REMOTE_TYPE_NAME\"] = (\n    df[\"REMOTE_TYPE_NAME\"]\n    .astype(str).str.strip().str.lower()\n    .replace({\"[none]\": None, \"none\": None, \"unknown\": None, \"nan\": None, \"na\": None, \"null\": None, \"\": None})\n)\n\n# Count each type\nremote_counts = df[\"REMOTE_TYPE_NAME\"].value_counts()\n\n# Visual\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))\nplt.pie(\n    remote_counts.values,\n    labels=remote_counts.index,\n    autopct=\"%1.1f%%\",\n    startangle=90,\n    wedgeprops={\"edgecolor\": \"white\"}\n)\nplt.title(\"Remote vs. On-Site Job Distribution\", fontsize=13)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.savefig(\"figures/remote_vs_onsite.png\", dpi=300, bbox_inches=\"tight\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pie chart was selected to display the proportions of job types (remote, hybrid, and on-site). This format offers an intuitive visual summary, helping job seekers understand the flexibility of job opportunities in 2024.\nThe job market here is overwhelmingly remote: nearly four out of five postings (78.4%) are fully remote, while another 14.4% offer hybrid options. Only 7.3% require full on-site work. This mix signals strong employer flexibility and broad access to roles regardless of location, with hybrid emerging as a meaningful—but secondary—model. For candidates, remote-first skills (self-management, async collaboration) are likely at a premium, while fully on-site opportunities are comparatively scarce."
